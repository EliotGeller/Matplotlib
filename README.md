# Matplotlib
A couple of small Python files used to learn about the matplotlib library and some of its functions.

FirstScatter.py is my first time using matplotlib and pyplot.  It has a simple scatter plot and a few line plots used to understand how graph customization works using the library.

Histograms.py is my second matplotlib file where I explored some of the histogram features.

BarPlots.py is my third matplotlib file.  This went over similar method parameters from the previous files.

StackPlots.py tested the different baselines and weights in a stack plot of 4 data sets of random numbers.

PieCharts.py tested the included .pie parameters included in pyplot, such as colors, exploding, and rotation of a pie chart.
