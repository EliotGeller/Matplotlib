# Matplotlib
A couple of small Python files used to learn about the matplotlib library and some of its functions.

FirstScatter.py is my first time using matplotlib and pyplot.  It has a simple scatter plot and a few line plots used to understand how graph customization works using the library.

Histograms.py is my second matplotlib file where I explored some of the histogram features.

BarPlots.py is my third matplotlib file.  This went over similar method parameters from the previous files.
